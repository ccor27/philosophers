                      THIS IS FROM THE SUBJECT OF INTERNET (EVALUATION SHEET)

- should not eat and should die --> 1 800 200 200 (I don't have that validation, for that reason I get a deadlock, I have to fix it)
- a philo should die --> 4 310 200 100

                      THINGS TO HAVE IN MIND OR INVESTIGATE
- is the order of parameters right? it seems that the order of them in the evl sheet is  different
- it seems that the ft_check_philo_death never find a philo died, I have to review that, specially the workflow of the philo process and monitor!
- validate that in each time ft_handle_threads/mutexes throw an error, free memory
- when use the detach of threads??
- when a philo dies, maybe others are wating for mutex release??
    but if I have just one philo?
- problems with the synchronization of the threads and monitor
    - somethings works others not 
    - see why after the monitor detects that a philo dies it keep wating 
       for something
