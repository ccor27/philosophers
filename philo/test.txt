Command to get the outputs that match in order to know if the number of meals was corrected
 ./philo 5 800 200 200 7 | grep -e "1 is eating" -e "2 is eating" -e "3 is eating" -e "4 is eating" -e "5 is eating"


To validate leaks
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --show-reachable=yes --track-origins=yes --trace-children=yes ./philo 2 800 200 200 7 | grep -e "1 is eating" -e "2 is eating" -e "3 is eating" -e "4 is eating" -e "5 is eating"

To validate if the specific philo eats the specific amount we specified
./philo 5 800 200 200 7 | grep "5 is eating" | wc -l

To test philos with a number of meals, in this case we should see 35, because it is the times the "is eating" phrase appears
./philo 5  800 200 200 7 | grep "is eating" | wc -l


test mandatory
- 1 800 200 200 // should no eat
- 5 800 200 200 // no one should die
- 5 800 200 200 7 //no one should die and all should eat 7 times
- 4 410 200 200 //no one should die
- 4 310 200 100 //one should die


Things to have in mind:

- valgrind slow the program because of its internal processes, so 
    we have to increase the time of die in order to avoid unexpected
    dies, however if we do not increase the time, the evaluator should 
    be aware of that and just validate that valgrind return 0 leaks
